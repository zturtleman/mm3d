This is the README file for Misfit Model 3D

Misfit Model 3D is a 3D model editor.  It was written and tested on Linux.
It is reported to run on other Unix-like operating systems. It also runs
on Windows. See INSTALL.WIN32 for Windows-specific instructions.

Misfit Model 3D requires Qt (5.x) with OpenGL support.  See the INSTALL file
for details on where to get these packages.

This program uses autoconf and automake for building from source.  What this
means is that if you are lucky you can install this program with these
easy steps:

   ./autosetup.sh
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install

This will build an 'mm3d' executable and install it in /usr/local/bin.
Documentation will be in /usr/local/share/doc/mm3d.

On macOS 10.11+, install homebrew from http://brew.sh and run the following
commands.

   brew install autoconf automake qt
   cpan App::cpanminus # choose sudo in the interactive command
   cpanm HTML::Template --sudo
   ./autosetup.sh
   CXX='clang++ -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++' ./configure --with-Qt-dir=/usr/local/Cellar/qt/5.10.0_1
   make
   make mm3d.app

This will build an 'Misfit Model 3D.app' AppBundle. The help manual
only works if you run "sudo make install".

For more detailed installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.
See INSTALL.WIN32 for Windows-specific instructions.
