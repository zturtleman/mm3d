      <h1>Face Details</h1>

      <h2> Overview </h2>

      <p>
      A face is a polygon defined by connecting vertices in 3D space.
      In MM3D, all polygons are triangles. Any geometric shape
      that is more complex than a triangle is composed of multiple triangles.
      Faces may be drawn as filled polygons or as wireframes, depending
      on settings in the View menu.
      </p>

      <p>
      All faces are one-sided. When a triangle is drawn as a filled polygon,
      the side that faces the camera is drawn in a light gray color. The
      side that faces away from the camera is drawn as dark gray.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Some
      renderers do not draw polygons that face away from the camera (this
      is known as back-face culling). In MM3D, you can enable
      or disable drawing of polygons that face away from the camera.
      </p>

      <p>
      A face's "normal" is a line that is perpendicular to the plane of
      the polygon. This line defines how light reflects off of a polygon,
      and also helps the renderer determine if the polygon is facing the
      camera or not. If faces are connected to each other, the normals
      can be averaged to make the edges where they connect appear smooth.
      You cannot directly manipulate a face's normal, but you can
      influence the averaging calculations by assigning faces to a group
      and then changing the group properties. See the
      <a href="olh_groupwin.html">Group&nbsp;Window</a> for details.
      </p>

      <h2> Creating a Face </h2>
      
      <p>
      Faces are created implicitly when more complex geometric shapes are
      created. Select
      any tool that creates a geometric shape (such as a cube, sphere, or
      cylinder) and it will create new triangles which combine to form
      the desired shape.
      </p>

      <h2> Other Face Details </h2>

      <p>
      To increase the level of detail, one face can be subdivided
      into four faces using the
      <a href="olh_commands.html#subdivide">Subdivide&nbsp;Faces</a> command.
