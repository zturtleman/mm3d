      <h1>Groups Window</h1>

      <p>
      The <b>Groups Window</b> is used to add or remove model groups (collections
      of faces) 
      You may also set which faces are in which groups and assign textures.
      Select <b>Edit Groups</b> from the <a href="olh_mainwin.html">Main Window</a>'s 
      <b>Materials</b> menu.
      </p>

      <p>
      The combo box at the top of the window contains the names of all groups
      in this model.  You can select a group name and use the
      face assignment buttons (<b>Assign As Group</b> and <b>Add To Group</b>)
      to set which faces belong in this group.
      You may also use the <b>Select Faces In Group</b> button to 
      select the faces that belong to the group (this will clear any selected
      vertices and faces) and the <b>Unselect Faces In Group</b> button
      to unselect (other selected faces and vertices will remain selected).
      </p>

      <p>
      To add a new group click the <b>New</b> button and enter a name (names do
      not need to be unique, though duplicate names may be confusing for other
      people using this model).  
      The name is limited to 31 characters.
      To remove a group from the model, select the group name in the combo box
      and click the <b>Delete</b> button.
      Note that deleting a
      group in this window does not delete any faces that are in the group.
      This only deletes the group name.
      To rename a group click the <b>Rename</b> button.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Smoothness</b> slider allows you to change how smooth the surface
      of the polygons of the group appear (this does not change the position of
      vertices, it only affects the normals used for lighting calculations).  A
      smoothness of 0 will show all the polygons as flat polygons.  A smoothness
      of 100 will make the polygons appear as smooth as possible in viewports
      with smooth polygon shading enabled.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Max Angle</b> slider allows you to change specify the maximum
      angle that will automatically be smoothed.  Faces that share an edge at
      an angle greater than this angle will be drawn as a sharp edge.  Faces
      that share an edge at an angle less than this angle will be drawn as
      a rounded edge  (this does not change the position of
      vertices, it only affects the normals used for lighting calculations).
      </p>

      <p>
      To assign a texture to a group, select the group name in the group combo
      box and select a texture name in the texture combo box.  A preview of 
      the texture image will be displayed in the frame below the texture combo
      box.

      to ignore any changes.
