<h2><a name="modeltypes"></a>Model Types</h2>

<p>
An MD3 model contains a set of meshes and tags. Some in-game Quake models
are actually composites of several MD3 files. For example, a player
model consists of head.md3, upper.md3, and lower.md3 files. Tags within
these files tell Quake how to assemble the model files into one single
model.
</p>

<p>
Maverick Model 3D is capable of loading and saving a single MD3 file, or loading 
and saving all files in a player model as one model.
</p>

<p>
If you attempt to load
a file named head.md3, upper.md3, or lower.md3 and the other two files are
present, MM3D will ask you if you want to load all sections as a player model.
Answer <b>Yes</b> to load all three files as one model. Answer <b>No</b> to
load only the specified model file.
</p>

<p>
When you save a model, MM3D will ask to save as a player model if the following conditions
are met. If any of the following conditions are not met, the model will be saved
as a single MD3 file.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The saving file name is head.md3, upper.md3, or lower.md3</li>
<li>The model contains at least two points; named <b>tag_torso</b> and
   <b>tag_head</b>.</li>
<li>The model contains at least one group beginning with h_ (for head meshes),
u_ (for upper body meshes), and l_ (for lower body meshes).</li>
<li>The MD3_composite <a href="olh_metawin.html">metadata</a> value is not set to <b>0</b> (zero)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the model is saved as a player model the animation.cfg file will be created
automatically. If the model is saved as a single file, no animation.cfg file
will be created.
</p>

<p>
Skin files are read automatically for player and non-player models. Skin files
are never created or modified by MM3D. If you wish to change or create
a skin file you must do this step manually.
</p>

<h3><a name="playermodels">Player Models</a></h3>
<p>
A typical MD3 player model might be 60 GL units tall and 30 wide.
The base of the feet should be at -24.</p>
<p>Player models consist of three model
files: head.md3, upper.md3, and lower.md3. Usually these correspond to
head, torso, and legs respectively. These three models are connected with <a
 href="#tags">tags</a> (Points in MM3D). The weapon and Team Arena CTF flag
the player is holding are also connected to the player model with a tag.</p>
<p>
Typical tags for player models:<br>
<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th><b>Model File</b></th>
      <th><b>Tags in model</b></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>head.md3</td>
      <td>tag_head</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>upper.md3</td>
      <td>tag_head, tag_torso, tag_weapon, (Team Arena) tag_flag</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>lower.md3</td>
      <td>tag_torso</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>
Other unknown tags will be saved in all model files which can be used by Quake 3 mods.
</p>
<p>You can have multiple skins for a player model. Each md3 file should
have a corresponding skin file (head_default.skin, lower_default.skin,
upper_default.skin). Usually there are at least three skins for a
player model: _default.skin, _red.skin, and _blue.skin. For more on
skins see <a href="#textures">Skins and Textures</a>.
</p>

<p>Player models need an animation.cfg file to specify which frames
correspond to in-game actions. An animation.cfg file might look like 
the <a href="#animation_cfg_example">example below</a>.
All animation sequences should have at least one frame.
</p>

<p>
Head models do not have animations in Quake 3. The head is attached to
the <b>tag_head</b> tag in the upper body model. If you want to animate
the head, you can hide the <b>tag_head</b> inside the model
and do all the head animations in the torso (upper) meshes. You should
still make a head model because it is displayed on the HUD.</p>

<p>It's possible to add support for head animations by modifying the
Quake 3 code. MM3D supports <b>ALL_</b> animation prefix for head/upper/lower animations and
<b>HEAD_</b> animation prefix for head-only animations.</p>

<p>
The animation name affects which sections of the player the animation is exported to.<br>
<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th><b>Animation Prefix</b></th>
      <th><b>Models</b></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ALL_</td>
      <td>upper.md3, lower.md3, head.md3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>BOTH_</td>
      <td>upper.md3, lower.md3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>TORSO_</td>
      <td>upper.md3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>LEGS_</td>
      <td>lower.md3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>HEAD_</td>
      <td>head.md3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Quake 3 player model animations must be in the same order as listed below.
The optional Quake III: Team Arena animations at the end of the list require <b>tag_flag</b>
tag in the upper model to be used in-game.
It is recommended to set <b>Loop</b> for each animation as listed below in the <a
 href="olh_animwin.html">Animation Panel</a>. This controls
whether the individual animations are marked as looping in the exported animation.cfg.<br>

<h4><a name="playermetadata">Player Metadata</a></h4>
<p>
Set MD3_CFG_* <a href="olh_metawin.html">metadata</a> to insert a keyword into the animation.cfg. For example, set <b>MD3_CFG_sex</b> meta data to value <b>f</b> to specify that the player model is female. Keywords and values are automatically detected when loading a player model. Any arbitraty keywords can be used. Keywords should not start with an animation prefix (ALL_, BOTH_, TORSO_, LEGS_, or HEAD_) as it may be detected as an animation when loaded by MM3D. Quake 3 only supports sex, footsteps, headoffset, fixedtorso, and fixedlegs.
Example:<br />
<pre>
sex f // m, f, or n
footsteps normal // footstep sfx: normal, boot, flesh, mech, or energy
headoffset 0 0 0 // head offset when displayed on HUD
fixedtorso // don't rotate torso pitch when looking up or down
fixedlegs // don't rotate legs (always align with torso)
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Set the <b>MD3_AnimKeyword</b> metadata value to <b>1</b> to list animation names at the beginning of line in animation.cfg. This is automatically detected when loading a player model. It is not supported by Quake 3. It is used by Elite Force Single Player and Turtle Arena.
Example:<br />
<pre>
BOTH_DEATH1 0       32      0       25
BOTH_DEAD1  32      1       0       25
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Set the <b>MD3_NoSyncWarning</b> metadata value to <b>1</b> to disabling writing sync warnings in animation.cfg for TORSO_ATTACK, TORSO_ATTACK2, TORSO_DROP, and TORSO_RAISE. It is used by Turtle Arena which does not feature first person <a href="#handmodels">hand models</a>.
</p>
<p>
Set the <b>MD3_EliteLoop</b> metadata value to <b>1</b> to use Elite Force Single Player style looping values in animation.cfg. -1 for not looping and 0 for looping instead of Quake 3 style 0 for not looping and number of frames for looping. It is not supported by Quake 3. This is automatically detected when loading a player model if a looping value is -1.
</p>


<h3><a name="weaponmodels">Weapon Models</a></h3>
<p>
A typical MD3 weapon might be 5 GL units wide
and 45 long. They usually would have no animations, although it should
be possible to add animation by modifying the Quake 3 code. You can
also add texture animations with shaders. Weapons are attached to the
<b>tag_weapon</b> <a href="#tags">tag</a> in the player model's upper
model or first person hand model. Weapons typically have tag named
<b>tag_weapon</b> at the model origin (0,0,0), however it is not used by
the Quake 3 code. Some weapons have a tag named <b>tag_flash</b> where
Quake 3 attaches the muzzle flash model (typically (weapon)_flash.md3 in
the same directory). Some weapons have a tag named <b>tag_barrel</b>
where Quake 3 attaches the barrel model (typically (weapon)_barrel.md3
in the same directory).
</p>

<h3><a name="handmodels">Hand Models</a></h3>
<p>
A hand model is used for positioning the first person weapon model.
The model consists of only an animated <b>tag_weapon</b> <a href="#tags">tag</a>
and is not rendered by Quake 3.
</p>

<h2><a name="tags">Tags</a></h2>

<p>
Quake 3 uses tags to join models to each other. MM3D
loads tags as points, so if you want to create a tag make a Point
(<a href="olh_pointdetails.html">more details about points</a>). The
point name should be whatever you want the name of the tag to be. The
red axis of the tag is forward, the blue axis of the tag is up, and the
green axis of the tag is left. For example you want the red side of
that tag to face front for tag_weapon.
</p>

<p>
The MD3 orientation for tags is not the default orientation for MM3D points,
so you must rotate any points you create into the correct orientation.
</p>

<h2><a name="animations">Animations</a></h2>
<p>
MD3 animations specify vertex positions for each
vertex for each frame of each animation. This can be tedious. When
creating a model from scratch it is usually
easier to save the model in MM3D format and create skeletal animations.
Then
when you are ready to export to MD3, convert the skeletal animations to
frame
animations using the <a href="olh_animsetwin.html">Animation Sets
Window</a>
and save as an MD3.
</p>
<p>
Because of the enormous overhead of saving undo information for
animations upon
insertion and deletion of vertex and face primitives, you are not
allowed to
add or remove primitives from a model that has frame animations. You
may,
however, merge another existing model into the one you are working on.
This is another reason why it is best to work with MM3D files and
skeletal
animations and only export MD3 files when necessary.
</p>
<p>
MM3D will save all frame (vertex, mesh deformation) animations when 
saving as MD3.
</p>

<h2><a name="paths">Paths</a></h2>
<p>
When an MD3 model is saved, path information is stored
in the model. Quake3 uses a VFS (virtual file system), and you must tell
Quake3 where your files are located in this VFS. For
example a player model might be located in the Quake3 VFS at
models/players/man/. So all the models and textures should probably be
located in there and when you make a pk3 file (zip file really), it
should contain that directory hierarchy.</p>
<p>
We still need MM3D to save paths and filenames with
models/players/man/. This is where the MD3_PATH <a
 href="olh_metawin.html">metadata</a> attribute comes in. You should
set the MD3_PATH metadata attribute to models/players/man/. MD3 Filter
will append all filenames that gets stored in the MD3 file to
MD3_PATH. So your body.tga texture when saved would be written in the
MD3 file as models/players/man/body.tga. When quake3 opens it that is
where it will look in the VFS.</p>
<p>
Note: The Quake 3 VFS does not start with a /.
</p>

<h2><a name="textures">Skins and Textures</a></h2>
<p>
The MD3 filter can load any image type as a texture if
MM3D can use it. When looking for a texture file it ignores the
extension and finds any loadable texture with the the right file name
(regardless of extension). For example if the model says it should use a file
called body.tga, MD3 Filter could use body.png if it exists.</p>
<p></p>
<p>MD3 filter looks for texture images and skin
files in the same directory as the model regardless of the values for
paths contained in the model.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In general the MD3 filter attempts to load skins
in the following manner:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> First it will look for .skin files with the
following pattern. {modelName}_*.skin It will load all images inside
those skin files. It will set the material to the image contained in
{modelName}_default.skin. </li>
  <li> If no .skins files are there it will use shaderName specified in
the model to look for a texture file. </li>
  <li> If that does not exist it will look for a valid texture whose
filename matches {meshName}.* </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
When saving MD3 models it sets the shader name to the name of the texture that
is assigned to the group. Also note that Quake3 by default only loads
TGA and JPG files.</p>
<p>
A skin file should be of the form indicated below.
</p>
<p>
mesh_name,MD3_PATH/textureFilename
</p>
<p>
and example upper_default.skin:
</p>
<p>u_body,models/players/man/default_b.tga<br/>
u_cape,models/players/man/default_c.tga
</p>

<h3><a name="shaders"></a>Shaders</h3>
<p>
Currently MD3 filter will not load Quake3 .shader files.
These are files that could do complex OpenGL operations.
You can still use shader files with your model inside Quake3 by
creating the shader manually. Here is a example:
</p>
<p>Create a shader file in the scripts directory (at the top of the VFS next to models directory) called player-(your model).shader containing:</p>
<pre>// comment: Use MD3_PATH/textureFilename without extension.
models/players/man/default_b
{
	{
		map models/players/man/default_b.tga // with extension
		rgbGen wave sin 0.5 0.5 0 1.5 // make color be a sine wave
	}
}

models/players/man/default_c
{
	{
		map models/players/man/default_c.tga
		rgbGen identityLighting // full bright
	}
}</pre>
<p>Quake3 should see the shader and use it instead of just the texture.</p>

<h2><a name="md3limits"></a>MD3 Limits</h2>
<p>
The MD3 file format has several limits that you should consider when
making a model for this format. These are outlined below. If your model
has more that the MD3 limit, the file will not be saved correctly and
you should get a error message.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Only faces and verticies in a group get saved.</li>
  <li>The MD3_PATH+file name cannot be longer than <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">63</span> characters.&nbsp; (Textures and
model names)<br>
  </li>
  <li>The group name and point name cannot be longer than <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">63</span> characters.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="quake3limits"></a>Quake3 Limits</h2>
<p>
Quake3 only supports a limit amount of geometry. These are outlined below.
Other games may have different limits. You should get a error message in
the Quake3 console if your model has more geometry than the Quake3 limit.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maximum of <span style="font-weight: bold;">1999</span>
Triangles per Group</li>
  <li>Maximum of <span style="font-weight: bold;">999</span>
Verticies per Group</li>
</ul>
<p>Vertexes in MM3D are shared between materials and texture coordinates.
Exporting to MD3 may have a greater number of vertexes. You cannot solely
