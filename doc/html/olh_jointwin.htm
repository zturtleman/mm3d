      <h1>Joints Window</h1>

      <p>
      The <b>Joints Window</b> can be opened by selecting <b>Joints...</b> from 
      the <b>Primitives</b> menu.
      The <b>Joints Window</b> allows you to rename bone joints and assign vertices
      to bone joints.  To create bone joints, see the 
      <a href="olh_tools.html#joint">Create Bone Joint</a> tool.
      </p>

      <h2> Joints List </h2>

      <p>
      The joints combo box lists all the bone joints in the model.  Selecting 
      a joint in the combo box will cause that joint to be selected (all other
      joints will be unselected).  After selecting a joint you can rename it,
      delete it, or assign vertices to it.
      </p>

      <h2> Rename </h2>

      <p>
      The <b>Rename</b> button allows you to rename a bone joint.  Bone joint names
      do not have to be unique (unless you are exporting to Milkshape 3D format).
      </p>

      <h2> Delete </h2>

      <p>
      The <b>Delete</b> button deletes a bone joint.  The <b>parent</b> joint
      of the selected joint will become the <b>parent</b> of all the selected
      joint's <b>child</b> joints.  You cannot delete the root joint unless
      it is the only joint.
      </p>

      <h2> Select Joint Vertices </h2>

      <p>
      The <b>Select Joint Vertices</b> button selects all the vertices that
      are assigned to the selected bone joint.  All other vertices are unselected.
      </p>

      <h2> Select Unassigned Vertices </h2>

      <p>
      The <b>Select Unassigned Vertices</b> button selects all the vertices that
      are not assigned to any bone joint.  All assigned vertices are unselected.
      </p>

      <h2> Assign Vertcies to Joint </h2>

      <p>
      The <b>Assign Vertices to Joint</b> button assigns all the selected
      vertices to the selected bone joint.  Selected vertices that were assigned
      to another joint will now only be assigned to the new one (a vertex may
      be assigned to only one bone joint).  Unselected vertices assigned to the
      current joint will still be assigned to the current joint.
