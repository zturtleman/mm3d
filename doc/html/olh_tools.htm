      <h1>Using the toolbar</h1>

      <p>
      The <b>Toolbar</b> has a set of tool buttons.  The tool buttons
      represent tools that allow you to manipulate a model interactively.  
      For example, you can select the &quot;Create Cube&quot; tool
      and then click and drag the mouse in a viewport on the Main Window to
      create a cube.
      </p>

      <p>
      There are two types of tools in the toolbar: Creation tools and 
      manipulation tools.  Creation tools create new vertices, faces, and
      joints interactively
      in various shapes such as cubes and spheres.  Manipulation tools
      allow you to interactively change faces, vertices, and joints which already exist.  
      Manipulation tools include moving, scaling, and rotation tools.  Typically
      manipulation tools only operate on vertices, faces, or joints which have been selected
      with the "Select" tool.  
      </p>
      
      <p>It is important to note that faces often share
      vertices.  Unselected faces may be modified by changes to vertices which
      are also part of a selected face.  To disconnect faces from each other
      so that they do not share vertices, see the <b>Unweld vertices</b> command.
      </p>

      <p>
      Some tools have additional options, which appear in an a separate
      toolbar.  For example, the sphere tool has an option that specifies
      how many triangles the sphere will be composed of.
      </p>

      <h1>Tools</h1>

      <a name="select"></a>
      <h2>Select</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <img alt="Select vertex tool icon" src="olh_images/tools/selectvertextool.png"/>
      <img alt="Select face tool icon" src="olh_images/tools/selectfacetool.png"/>
      <img alt="Select connected tool icon" src="olh_images/tools/selectconnectedtool.png"/>
      <img alt="Select group tool icon" src="olh_images/tools/selectgrouptool.png"/>
      <img alt="Select bone joint tool icon" src="olh_images/tools/selectbonetool.png"/>
      <img alt="Select point tool icon" src="olh_images/tools/selectpointtool.png"/>
      <img alt="Select projection tool icon" src="olh_images/tools/selectprojtool.png"/>
      <br/>
      There are five <b>Select</b> tools that allow you to select vertices, faces, groups,
      bone joints, points, and texture projections.  Each behaves in a similar manner as described below.
      </p>

      <h3>Mouse operations</h3>
      <p>
      Click and drag in a canvas viewport with the left mouse button.
      This will create a bouding box.  When you release the mouse button all
      objects of the desired type (vertices, faces, groups, or joints) that are within
      the bouding box will be selected.  In the case of faces or groups, the
      entire face or group does not need to be within the bouding box.  If any
      portion of the object is within the bouding box it will be selected.
      </p>

      <p>Each time you press the left mouse button you begin a new selection.
      If you want the selection to be cumulative, you may hold a shift key
      down to prevent the tool from unselecting vertices.  Using the shift
      key in this way you may select multiple objects by repeatedly using
      the left mouse button.
      </p>

      <p>The right mouse button is used to unselect objects.  You do not need
      to hold the shift key down to prevent clearing all of the current selection.
      This is implicit when using the right mouse button.
      <p>

      <p>
      The select faces tool has an option to select back-facing faces.
      If checked, any faces in the selected region will be selected (this is 
      the default behavior).  If unchecked, only faces that are facing the 
      camera in the selected region will be selected.
      </p>

      <h3>Animation mode</h3>
      <p>
      The select tools operate the same way in animation mode as they do
      in model edit mode; however, some animation types do not allow you to
      select some objects.  For example, in skeletal animation mode you can
      only manipulate bone joints.
      </p>

      <p>
      <h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
      <ul>
         <li> <b>V</b> - Select Vertices </li>
         <li> <b>F</b> - Select Faces </li>
         <li> <b>G</b> - Select Groups </li>
         <li> <b>C</b> - Select Connected </li>
         <li> <b>B</b> - Select Bone Joints </li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <a name="move"></a>
      <h2>Move</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <img alt="Move tool icon" src="olh_images/tools/movetool.png"/><br/>
      The <b>Move</b> tool moves selected vertices and faces.
      </p>

      <h3>Mouse operations</h3>
      <p>
      Press and hold the left or right mouse button in a canvas view to 
      begin a move operation.  Drag the mouse with a button down to move 
      selected vertices or faces in a canvas view.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can force the move tool to only move in one dimension by holding
      the shift key.  The first dimension the tool detects movement on will
      be the only dimension you can move the selected primitives in.
      </p>

      <h3>Animation mode</h3>
      <p>
      In animation mode the move tool moves vertices or bone joints.  The
      move tool may have no effect on certain types of animations.  In skeletal
      animations, moving a bone joint will set a translation keyframe for
      the current frame of the current animation.  For frame animations, 
      moving vertices will set the vertex position for the current frame
      of the current animation.
      </p>

      <a name="rotate"></a>
      <h2>Rotate</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <img alt="Rotate tool icon" src="olh_images/tools/rotatetool.png"/><br/>
      The <b>Rotate</b> tool rotates selected vertices and faces around a point.
      </p>

      <h3>Mouse operations</h3>
      <p>
      Press and hold the left mouse button in a canvas view to begin a
      rotate operation.  Drag the mouse around the rotation point (default
      rotation point is the
      origin, but this can be changed with the right mouse button).  
      </p>

      <p>
      Hold the shift button to rotate selected vertices in 15 degree increments.
      This can be useful if you want to rotate something by an exact amount
      (like 15, 30, 45, 90, or 180 degrees.
      </p>

      <p>
      The right mouse button sets the rotation point in the canvas view.  The
      rotation point is indicated by a green crosshair.
      <p>

      <h3>Animation mode</h3>
      <p>
      In animation mode the rotate tool rotates vertices for frame animations
      and sets rotation keyframes for bone joints in skeletal animations.  The
      rotation of vertices is identical to the operation in model edit mode.
      The rotation of bone joints is different from model edit mode.  
      The rotation is always centered on the bone joint.
      </p>

      <a name="scale"></a>
      <h2>Scale</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <img alt="Scale tool icon" src="olh_images/tools/scaletool.png"/><br/>
      <b>Scale</b> selected vertices and faces.
      </p>

      <h3>Mouse operations</h3>
      <p>
      Press and hold a mouse button to begin a scale operation.  The
      scale tool will find the bounds of the selected vertices.  The scale
      factor will be applied towards the nearest bounds (left, right, top, bottom)
      of the selected region.  The scale is based on the distance from the
      far corner of the bounding region.  If you move the mouse to the opposite 
      side of the bounding region the selected vertices will scale back in the
      original direction.
      </p>

      <p>
      The amount of scaling is based on the position of the mouse
      relative to the far bounding corner, and the position of each selected
      vertex from the far bounding corner (vertices closer to the mouse will
      scale more than vertices closer to the far bounding corner).
      </p>

      <p>
      You can specify whether to scale from the far corner of the selected
      mesh or the center of the selected mesh by changing the <b>Point</b>
      combo box in the toolbar.  
      By default the center point is used.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can force the scale tool to preserve the aspect ratio of the
      scaled object in 2 or 3 dimensions using the combo box in the toolbar.
      By default the aspect ratio is not preserved.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can force the scale tool to only scale in one dimension by holding
      the shift key.  The first dimension the tool detects movement on will
      be the only one scaled.  The shift key is ignored if you are preserving
      the aspect ratio through the combo box (input will only be counted on
      in one dimension, but 2 or 3 will be scaled by that input).
      </p>

      <h3>Animation mode</h3>
      <p>
      In animation mode the scale tool scales vertices for frame animations.
      It has no effect on skeletal animations.
      </p>

      <img alt="Shear tool icon" src="olh_images/tools/sheartool.png"/><br/>
      <b>Shear</b> selected vertices and faces.
      </p>

      <h3>Mouse operations</h3>
      <p>
      Press and hold a mouse button to begin a shear operation.  The shear tool
      will find the bounds of the selected vertices.  The nearest edge of the 
      bounding region will be dragged in the direction of mouse movements.  For
      example if the nearest bounding edge is the top edge, the top edge will
      move left or right while the bottom edge will remain stationary.
      </p>

      <p>
      Horizontal edges move left or right.  Vertical edges move up or down.  
      Vertices between the moving edge and anchored edge will move proportionally
      based on their relative position between the two edges.
      <p>

      <h3>Animation mode</h3>
      <p>
      In animation mode the shear tool shears vertices for frame animations.
      It has no effect on skeletal animations.

      The <b>Create Vertex</b> tool creates a vertex that is not connected
      to any triangles.</p>
      
      <p>
      Normally vertices that are created when triangles are
      created will also be deleted when triangles are deleted. A vertex
      created with the <b>Create Vertex</b> tool is a &quot;Free Vertex&quot;.
      You can create a triangle connected to this vertex then delete the
      triangle later and the vertex will still be present. 
      A &quot;Free Vertex&quot; will only be deleted if it is selected 
      explicitly and deleted.
      </p>

      <h3>Mouse operations</h3>

      <p>
      When you select the create cube tool the cube tool bar will appear.  You
      can use the cube tool bar to force the new cube to be cube shaped 
      (the same width, height, and depth).  You can also increase the number of
      faces that make up the cube by changing the value of segments.  The
      segment value is N for an N by N by N cube.  So a segment value of 3 would
      give you nine sets of squares (3x3) on each cube face (9 squares, 18 faces).
      </p>

      <h3>Mouse operations</h3>
      <p>
      Press and hold a mouse button to begin creating a cube.  The first corner

      (lengthwise) of the cylinder by setting the segments spin box.  
      You can increase the the number of sides
      (around the cylinder) of the cylinder by setting the sides spin box.  
      You can make a cylinder hollow by using
      the width spin box.  The width is how think the cylinder is (as a percent
      of the radius).  100 is solid and 0 is an extremely thin cylinder.
      The scale is the size of one end of the cylinder relative to the other as
      a percentage of the total diameter.  100 is a cylinder, 0 is a cone with
      one pointed end.
      </p>

      <h3>Mouse operations</h3>
      <p>
      Press and hold a mouse button to begin creating a cylinder.  The diameter
      of the cylinder will be the &quot;height&quot; (vertical distance)
      in the current canvas view.  If the cylinder is cone-shaped, the smaller
      end will be where the drag began.  Cylinders are always &quot;horizontal&quot;
      in the current viewport.  You can use the rotate tool to change the orientation
      of a cylinder that has been created (holding down shift during rotation will
      allow you to rotate in 15 degree increments).

      <h2>Create Torus</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <img alt="Create torus tool icon" src="olh_images/tools/torustool.png"/><br/>
      The <b>Create Torus</b> tool creates a set of faces in the shape of a torus.
      The torus is always drawn with the &quot;hole&quot; visible in the canvas view
      where the torus was created.  You can increase the polygon count of the 
      torus by changing the &quot;smooth&quot; value.
      </p>

      <p>
      When you select the torus tool the torus tool bar will appear.
      </p>

      <p>
      The width is width of the cylindrical portion wrapped around the center.
      50 means the cylinder spans from the far outside of the torus to halfway to the
      middle of the torus.  100 means the cylinder spans all the way to the center of the
      torus.  199 means the torus will be almost spherical.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can check the circle checkbox to force the torus to be circular.

      The <b>Create Polygon</b> tool creates a triangle strip or fan.
      Each left click will create a new vertex for the polygon.
      </p>

      <p>
      When you select the polygon tool the polygon tool bar will appear.
      </p>

      <p>
      If the fan checkbox is checked the polygon will be a triangle fan.
      If the checkbox is unchecked, the polygon will be a triangle strip.

      <img alt="Create bone joint tool icon" src="olh_images/tools/jointtool.png"/><br/>
      The <b>Create Bone Joint</b> tool creates a bone joint connected to the nearest bone
      joint.
      </p>

      <h3>Mouse operations</h3>
      <p>
      Press a mouse button to create a bone joint.  Hold the button
      down to move the joint where you want it.  If there are no other
      joints the first joint you create will be a root joint.  If there
      are other joints, the new joint will be connected to the closest
      existing joint (the existing joint will be the "parent" of the
      new joint).
      </p>

      <p>
      The closest joint is the closest joint in the two dimensions of
      the orthographic canvas view you are creating the bone joint in.
      The third dimension (the depth) is not included in the distance
      calculation.
      </p>


      <p>
      If you want the joint to be connected to a joint other than the
      closest one to the place where the joint will be positioned, create
      it near the parent joint and drag it to its target location.

      <p>
      <img alt="Create point tool icon" src="olh_images/tools/pointtool.png"/><br/>
      The <b>Create Point</b> tool creates a point. Points have a position and a
      direction. Points do not have a specific purpose for MM3D. They can be used
      as bolt points or other custom-purpose tags for model exporters or game
      engines. For example, the MD3 filter looks for specially named points to
      act as MD3 &quot;tags&quot;.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can use the rotate tool to rotate a point into a new direction, or
      explicitly set the rotation using the properties panel. <!-- FIXME refrence properties panel -->
      </p>

      <p>
      Points can be assigned to bone joints in the same manner as vertices.

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <img alt="Create texture projection tool icon" src="olh_images/tools/projtool.png"/><br/>
      The <b>Create Texture Projection</b> tool creates an object to project a texture
      onto faces as a sphere or cylinder.  Texture Projections have a position and a
      rotation. Texture projections do not have a texture associated with them.
      The texture applied to faces is the texture assigned to the group to which the
      faces belong (in theory you could use the same texture projection to map two
      different textures onto two different sets of polygons).
      </p>
      
      <p> 
      A sphere is created by default. You can change the sphere to a cylinder
      using the Texture Projections  Window <!-- FIXME reference proj window --> or the 
      properties panel. <!-- FIXME reference properties -->
      </p>

      <p>
      Any faces that are selected when you create the projection will automatically
      be assigned to the projection.
      </p>

      <h3>Mouse operations</h3>
      <p>
      Press a mouse button to create a texture projection.  Hold the button
      down to scale and rotate the projection to the size and orientation that 
      you desire.
