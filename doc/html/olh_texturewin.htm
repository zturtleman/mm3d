      <h1>Materials Window</h1>

      <p>
      The <b>Materials Window</b> is used to add or remove model materials (aka, textures) 
      You may also modify the reflective properties of the material.
      Select <b>Edit Materials</b> from the <a href="olh_mainwin.html">Main Window</a>'s 
      <b>Matererials</b> menu.
      </p>

      <p>
      The combo box at the top of the window contains the names of all materials
      associated with this model.  You can select a material name and use the
      lighting property sliders and the 
      to adjust the reflective properties 
      (<b>Ambient</b>, <b>Diffuse</b>, <b>Specular</b>, 
      <b>Emissive</b>, and <b>Shininess</b>) 
      of the material.
      </p>

      <ul>
         <li> Ambient - Light reflected from no particular direction.
         <li> Diffuse - Light reflected from the primary light source.
         <li> Specular - Light reflected which brings out highlights in the material.
         <li> Emmisive - Light emmited from the material's surface.
      </ul>

      <p>
      Each lighting color value ranges from -1.0 to 1.0.
      You can drag the slider left to decrease a color's value, or drag it right to 
      increase a color's value.  You can also change a value by typing a new
      value into the text box next to the slider.
      </p>

      <p>
      The material preview can be a flat texture image or a 3D preview of the 
      texture mapped onto a cube.  Use the material preview combo box to
      switch between preview modes.
      </p>

      <p>
      To add a new material click the <b>New Material</b> and enter a name.
      To add a 2D texture image to the material, click the <b>Set Texture</b>
      button and select a file.  The
      file dialog box will show you which image file formats are supported.  You
      should select an image with dimensions that are a power of 2 (ie, 32x32,
      128x256, etc...).  Other sizes should work with Misfit, but may not work with
      other rendering engines.
      </p>

      <p>
      To remove a texture click the <b>X</b> button next to <b>Set Texture</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
      To add a new solid color material click the <b>New Color</b>.
      Use the lighting properties buttons to adjust the color of the material.
      </p>

      <p>
      To remove a material from the model, select the material name in the combo box
      and click the <b>Delete</b> button (this only removes the material from the model,
      the actual file on disk is not modified in any way).
      </p>

      <p>
      To rename a material click the <b>Rename</b> button.  This may be useful if you
      want the material name to match a group name, or if you have two materials with
      the same image but different lighting values.  Names do not need to be unique
      (though duplicate names may be confusing for other people using the model).
      </p>

      <p>
      You can change the texture wrapping behavior by changing the
      value of the the Wrap/Clamp combo boxes.  Wrap will cause the texture
      to wrap for texture coordinates that are outside of the 0.0 to 1.0 range.
      Clamp will cause the renderer to extend the edge of the texture in
      the desired direction.  The X and Y clamp values can be changed
      independently.
      </p>

      <p>
      Press <b>Ok</b> to keep your changes or press <b>Cancel</b> 
      to ignore any changes.
