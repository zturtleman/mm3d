   Front - proportions
Start modeling
   Cylinder, 4 segments, six sides
   Have to rotate (hold shift) to get it vertical
   select vertices and scale to chest size
   move vertices to match drawing
   Adjust dimensions in other viewports (but only adjust on the depth axis)
   edge turn at waist
      see problem edge, highlight
      select edge turn
      see corrected faces
   edge divide to add detail
   snap to vertex
      see also drag vertex
   hide
      back faces are getting in the 
      select, hide selected
   edge turn
      All down the side (single before and after picture)
   unhide
   Mirror
      Use boolean operation to cut it half
      Torso is object A
      Cube is object B
      Subtract B from A
      Simplify mesh
      Duplicate
         (note vertex count)
      Flip
      Select center vertices
      weld
         (note vertex count)
   Use proportions image in Right viewport
      Just for depth reference on next to leg
   Cylinder for leg
      6 segments, 8 sides
      horizontal, rotate to vertical
      scale to match leg width
   Connect
      Remove faces under torso where leg will connect
      Remove top faces above leg where it will connect with torso
      snap to vertex to join vertices
      weld to connect
   Need to edge turn
      Finding exact faces in side view can be tricky
      Switch perspective to ortho and select faces that way
      Flip back to perspective
      Do ede turn and see result
   Move vertices to match up with leg (in side view)
   Make foot
      Select bottom faces to make ankle and heel
      Extrude tool
      Move toe-side leg vertices up to ankle top, snap nearest and and weld
      Extrude again to make foot
   Move vertices to match up with leg (in front view)
      Leg is kind of curvey, doesn't look natural
      Go back up leg and adjust vertex postions
   Duplicate leg, flip, select seam vertices, and weld
   Make less pigeon toed (100 to 101)
   Make arm
      8 segments, 8 sides, horizontal, don't need to rotate this time
      Match vertices to reference in front view
      Extrude where arm will meet shoulder
   Connect
      Rotate arm on X axis so that front view is now facing down (palm down)
      Remove shoulder and arm internal faces in preparation for weld
      Hide legs, arm, and far side of torso to get a better view
      Move vertices (snap to vertex for move tool) and weld
   Adjust vertices from front view again to make the cylinder more arm-shaped
      Looks kind of octogony, weld some vertices to make the shape look less blocky
   Make hand
      Extrude end of arm for hand
      Extrude side faces to make thumb
      Move vertices and weld to make thumb look less blocky
      Add smoothness by splitting faces
      Weld split faces to reconnect
      Do some edge turns on the thumb
   Arm looks good enough for now
      Don't want to duplicate and connect on to the shoulder on the other side
      Just delete half of torso, dup and flip along with arm
      Select all and weld (only near vertices are welded)
   Head
      Extrude torso top to make neck
      Remove neck top faces to make room to attach head
      Cylinder, 6 segments, 8 sides
      Horizontal, rotate it
      Use reference image to scale to basic head size
      Create visor by moving vertices, edge turning as necessary
      Shape back of helmet
      Adjust vertices to match head shape (in Front view)
      Edge divide and move vertices to create breathing mask area
      Face shield, duplicate and extrude to create inset
      Hide helmet to show what it looks like
      Face shield will be transparent, insde will be visible
      Connect neck to torso at shoulders
   Completed geometry (1x1 view)
