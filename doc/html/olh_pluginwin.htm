      <h1>Plugins Window</h1>

      <p>
      The <b>Plugins Window</b> shows you what plugins are installed and active.
      </p>

      <p>
      Plugins are located in a directory on your hard drive.  On Unix-like systems,
      Maverick Model 3D will try
      <code>$HOME/.mm3d/plugins</code>.  If that directory does not exist
      it will try in a shared directory (defaults to 
      <code>/usr/local/share/mm3d/plugins</code>, although this can be changed at
      install time).
      Maverick Model 3D will descend into subdirectories and follow symbolic links.
      On Windows, Maverick Model 3D uses the <code>plugins</code> subdirectory
      where Maverick Model 3D was installed.
      </p>


      <p>
      The main component of the plugins window is a table that contains
      a list of plugins.  Each plugin should also provide a <b>Version</b> string
      and a <b>Description</b> string.  There is also a <b>Status</b> column that tells you
      if the plugin is properly initialized and currently active.
      </p>

      <p>
      All plugins can be disabled at run time by specifying <code>--no-plugins</code> 
      on the command line.  Specific plugins can be disabled by specifying
      <code>--no-plugin=<i>plugin_name</i></code> on the command line.  
      <code>--no-plugin</code> can be specified more than once.
