For 1.4:
   Bump mm3dfilter version

   Make sure all plugins work with 1.3
      Enums changed
      Update ad3dsfilter with canExport

   Profile 1.3.4 vs. 1.3.5 on unaccelerated config

   FIXMEs
      Prevent editing model when invalid animation is active
         (animwin open when no animation)
      Apply matrix
         To selected (with/without frame anims)
         Global (with/without frame anims)
         Either will always affect skeletal anims implicitly
      utf8strtrunc
      Remove joint color from MS3D export options


For 1.6:
   Resample animation
   Change animation playback speed
   Bone Joints
      Interactive influence weight adjustment
      IK Considerations
   Fix relative paths when saving in a different directory
   Export/Import MM3D
      Geometry
      Materials
      Skeleton
      Animations
   Texture Projections
      Types
         Icosahedron
   Gradient textures
   Only list supported image formats in animation capture export
   Integrate libmisfit
   Make middle mouse button scroll zoom in on point under the mouse
   Delay normal calculation when manipulating a large number of vertices
   Fix MM3D data size problem (assume size instead of using read size)
   Embedded textures
      Implement embedded textures
      Extract embedded textures to external files
   Allow double-sided polygons
   Attract near/far
      Position decal
      2D/3D
      Curve: linear/sin/log/quad

Later:
   Warn user if some model properties will not be saved in
      specified format
   Format options:
      Model format-specific dialog box (like Save dialog)
         Must save in that format to get dialog
      Dialog always available (tabbed for each format?)
      Save format-specific options in MM3D format
      Options dialog can encode/decode
      Prompt at save time
   Only prompt for options on first save or on "Save As"
   Meta data context panel
      For meta data of any primitive
   Coloring on texture paint
   Adjust texture coordinates on turn edge?
   Adjust texture coordinates on split edge?
   On user path input, always replace backslashes with slashes
   MD3
      Custom export dialog to select groups, tags, and animations
      Handle missing/out-of-order animations more sanely
   Center viewport on mouse position
   Point meta data?
   Check flipping on 3DS texture coordinates
   Import heightmap as "terrain"
   Transformation - scale translation keyframes
   MM3D Unsupported data
      Load/save unknown type info
      UI for unknown type info
   Cylinder/Sphere Mapping
      Projection Window
         Show test pattern
         Move pole on sphere?
         Move pole on icosahedron?
   Bone Joints
      Multiple root joints
      Allowing reparenting and re-rooting of bone structure
         will invalidate keyframe animations
         have to deal with parents defined after children
   Allow setting of other OpenGL options?
   Commands
      Increase poly count to smooth (see blender?)
      Text
   Force save of a specific type
   Report OpenGL status (supported options)
   Unified drawing code
   Consider using glVertexPointer, glInterleavedArrays, or other draw optimization
